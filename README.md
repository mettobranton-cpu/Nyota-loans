# Koro Loans KE

A Node.js + PostgreSQL application portal with customer registration, phone OTP verification, customer application tracking and inbox, and a private admin review dashboard.

## Important before going live
This is a deployable application codebase, not a hosted/live website. Do not collect real customer data until the business's applicable lending authorization, privacy/data-protection obligations, customer notices, loan contracts, pricing and complaint process have been verified. The sample UI deliberately does not claim that an applicant is pre-approved. No application fee is charged by this code.

## Requirements
- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL database
- HTTPS hosting and a real domain for production
- Africa's Talking account and approved sender ID for live SMS

## Run locally
1. Create a PostgreSQL database, e.g. `koro_loans`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `DATABASE_URL`, a long random `SESSION_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f schema.sql`.
5. Run `npm start` and open `http://localhost:3000`.
6. Customer site: `/`. Admin sign-in: `/?admin=1`.

## SMS setup
By default `OTP_MODE=console`; OTPs are printed in the server logs for development and no SMS is sent. Only after configuring and testing the Africa's Talking production account, API key and approved sender ID should `OTP_MODE=live` be enabled. Keep secrets in the hosting provider's secret/environment settings, never in source code or chat.

## Production checklist
- Use a managed PostgreSQL database with backups and restricted access.
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`, HTTPS, a unique `SESSION_SECRET`, and secure environment variables.
- Replace the simple environment-based administrator credential with a managed admin identity, MFA, password rotation and role controls before real use.
- Add CSRF protection, account recovery, consent and privacy notice/version logging, data retention/deletion workflows, access logging, monitoring and security testing.
- Confirm OTP delivery, resend limits, phone normalization, and provider delivery receipts.
- Have Kenyan counsel/compliance professionals validate the applicable CBK authorization and ODPC/data-protection requirements, loan disclosures, fees, interest, repayment terms and complaints handling.
- Do not enable M-Pesa collection or upfront fees until the exact lawful payment purpose and customer disclosures have been reviewed and an authorized merchant account is configured.

## Fee schedule
The previously discussed fee tiers are intentionally not configured as charges. Confirm their legal basis, whether they are one-time or recurring, and full disclosure requirements before adding any fee to a customer offer.
